- the more you present, the less you prepare, like a feedback loop. Add the updates, novel things but mostly rely on prior experience
- Prep time depends on your material and audience
- Start from the end
  - define the goal and what you want the users to leave with
  - build a narrative leading to the goals
- Define your audience
  - who the audience is, their knowledge on technology/your talk subject, are they experts, what are their interests?
  - include little things that experts would appreciate, and that would bring the non-experts to speed
- Trust that the audience wants you to succeed 
- Be confident in speaking to the audience, they're there to learn and don't think about people who might know more than you. You're speaking to people who want to learn something new.
  - If need be, pick a 'friendly face'
- What do you want your audience to feel? Inspired?
  - show off a tool that might be cool, so that the audience sees at least one thing they might want to try later
- Memorise the order of the slides/presentation to maintain flow and avoid being surprised by your own slides
  - agenda slides every few mins
  - agenda in the easily accesible place with some talking points and 'do not forgets'
  - write down what each agenda covers and which demos are in each one
- Identify your body symptoms, your body is setting you up for success
- Be conscious of the time each section of your talk takes
  - you might leverage time from one section to another
  - keep track of time
- *Have two-three talks that you can do on moment's notice*
- Stage movement
  - move around a little, but have breaks to give the audience time to readjust your position
  - tie your speech content to the stage physically (e.g. right side is a server side, left side is the online side)
- You will get self-conscious about the words you pick, but you need to ignore it and just go with it. Keep your momentum.
- Replace 'ums' with silence.
