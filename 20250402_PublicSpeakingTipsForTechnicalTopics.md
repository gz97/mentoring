## Areas to cover in your presentation

### 1. *What* you are talking about
- introduce yourself
	- what is your background
	-	why are you the person to talk about the topic
	- stay positive about yourself and the topic (don't ridicule yourself, your experience, it's okay to say it was hard to learn but remember to stay positive)
-  explain the topic
  - what it is, why is it relevant, why are you talking about it, where it fits, how you use it

### 2. *Why* is it important
- explain why the audience should put effort into listening to you

### 3. *How* it works
- without the two previous sections, this section would be harder for the audience to focus on
- use a *flow* option to make the delivery more coherent and effective:
  - *process* flow - step-by-step explanation
    - used for most technical talks
    - *'first you do this, then this, afterwards this', etc*
  - *chronological* flow - timeline-focused
    - used for history of technology, how a feature evolved, sequence of events that lead to a result
    - *'first this happened, and finally this happened'*
  - *problem-solution* flow - highlights a challenge and demonstrates how to overcome it
    - present a problem and steps used to resolve it
    - used for troubleshooting sessions, demos of tool's capability
  - *comparative* flow - how two or more tools work
    - compare similarities and differences
  - *component-based* flow - breaks down a system/concept into individual parts and explains how each part functions and interacts
    - show each piece individually and then how they work together as a whole
    - used for explaining complex systems and architectures
  - *use-case* flow - how a feature/tool is applied in a specific scenario
    - walkthough a specific example of a use-case in the real world to show practical applications of what you are presenting

### 4. Closing remarks
- recap the main points of what you presented
- include URLs/resources you used
